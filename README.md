# Jordans first blog site

this site is a place where i can store my own personal blogs and people can visit
and look at all my blogs. I used tutors to help me write the code and work through some issues I was having.

## Instalation

There are no special installation instructions. It all runs from the browser and uses local storage to save the blog posts.

## Usage

visit the site, the link is below. Enter blog information into the form on the landing page. Hit the submit button to save the blog on the blog page. Once you hit the submit button you will be redirected to the page to view the blog posts.
Navigation buttons allow you to navigate to the projects page and back to the landing page. Also there is a link to my portfolio web site.

There is a button to change between light and dark themes.

## Contributing

the site was built using the help of some tutors but all code used was written by me.
